Hey, will you be there for me,
As if pentesters have reNgine,
An automated reconnaissance framework,
We'll always make our life perk.

As it focus with web application,
we need to have some configuration,
It streamlined recon process via Engine,
Also recon data correlation and organization.

We will do continuous monitoring as in rengine,
We have to follow our norms and displine,
It already backed by database and simple,
Even intuitive User Interface in nimble.

It makes easy for pentester to get recon,
Also creator get chance to represent in defcon,
It will be update time and again,
Hence, we can get upgraded version.

Pentester can choose schedule the scan,
Also we can get notified on notification,
Either we can use discord or telegram,
Or even slack we get notified of new subdomain.

We can import and export in interesting endpoints,
Also get gf pattern, and nuclei templates,
Configured Scan based on YAML,
Even we can use our engine as our choice.

Our focus has always been in recon data
With having very minimal efforts,
We can also have idea about http status,
Also, have idea on technology, services and ports.

We can have OSINT and IP Discovery,
Also have todos and CNAME discovery,
Even using nuclei and parallel scan,
It has ability to automatically report vulnerability.

We can simple run this tool in docker,
But we're recommmended to use in VPS,
Edit the dot env file and run the installation script,
Hope you could get your recon ease.
